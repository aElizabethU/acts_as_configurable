= ActsAsConfigurable

This plugin provides the ability to specify settings on a model class similarly
to the way columns are defined in migrations, including default values.

While you could get the same effect by creating a column for each individual
setting, this becomes cumbersome when there are more than a handful of
settings, or when the settings need to be changed frequently.

== Getting Started

First, install the plugin:

  $ ./script/plugin install git://github.com/omghax/acts_as_configurable.git

Note that git support for script/plugin is, at the time of this writing, only
available in edge Rails.  With any luck this will make its way into an official
release soon.

Next, declare acts_as_configurable in your model(s):

  class Blog < ActiveRecord::Base
    acts_as_configurable do |c|
      c.string :title, :default => "My Blog"
      c.integer :number_of_frontpage_articles, :default => 10
      c.boolean :enable_akismet, :default => false
    end
  end

This will define instance methods on Blog for each setting, with the
specified default values.  These attributes can be used in mass-assignment,
validations, and pretty much anywhere else you'd use a normal database column.

The available types of settings are :string, :integer, :boolean, and :object.

=== Strings

First let's take a look at string settings. These behave exactly as you would
expect them to.

Example:

  >> b = Blog.new
  >> b.title
  # => "My Blog"
  >> b.title = "My Custom Blog"
  >> b.title
  # => "My Custom Blog"

=== Integers

Integer settings work similarly to string settings, but are obviously coerced
into integers when their values are set.

=== Booleans

Here's how you deal with boolean settings. Note that these settings are very
flexible with what they accept during assignment.

[false]
  nil, 0, "0", "f", "false", false
[true]
  anything else

Example:

  >> b.enable_akismet?
  # => false
  >> b.enable_akismet = true
  >> b.enable_akismet?
  # => true

=== Objects

Object settings are the most flexible, and will allow you to use any
serializable ruby object to represent a setting's value. This should be used
with care as changes to your code can potentially break the records in your
database which contain serialized objects.
